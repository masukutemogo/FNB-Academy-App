              <h3>LIONS</h3>
              <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India.
                  It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its
                  tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. 
                  It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males,
                  related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large
                  ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.</p>
              
     <p>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted,
         it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia,
         from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in
         western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have
         declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. 
         Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for
         concern.</p>
              
   <p>One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and
       paintings, on national flags, and in literature and films. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman
       Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century.
       Cultural depictions of lions have occurred worldwide, particularly as a symbol of power and royalty.</p>
              
   <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
    <p>Lions are primarily found in Africa, south of the Sahara, in areas like savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands.
        A small population of Asiatic lions also exists in India's Gir Forest. </p>
