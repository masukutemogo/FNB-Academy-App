              <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
              <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella), or South African oryx, is a large antelope in the genus Oryx.
                  It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and (parts of) Zimbabwe,
                  mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which it is supremely adapted for survival.
                  Previously, some sources classified the related East African oryx,
                  or beisa oryx (Oryx beisa), as a subspecies.</p>
              
     <p>The name gemsbok is from Afrikaans, which itself is from the Dutch word of the same spelling, meaning "male chamois", 
         composed of gems (“chamois”) + bok (“buck, male goat”).
         [4] The Dutch gems is further from German Gämse ("chamois").
         [5] Although some superficial similarities in appearance (especially in the facial pattern) are noticed,
         the chamois and the oryx are not closely related.
         The usual pronunciation in English is /ˈɡɛmzbɒk/.[6]</p>
              
   <p>Gemsbok are light taupe to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump.
       Their tails are long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck,
       through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg.
       They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs,
       and both sexes have long, straight horns. Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch at the base of the tail,
       has less black on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks.
       One very rare color morph is the "golden oryx", in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden.</p>
              
   <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
    <p>Gemsbok, also known as Southern Oryx, are primarily found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Southern Africa,
        specifically in areas like the Kalahari and Karoo regions. 
        They are well-adapted to desert environments and can be seen in various game reserves and private land in Botswana,
        Namibia, and South Africa. </p>
